## About this Repository

This is a Selene bundle implementing a client user interface based on the roleplaying game Illarion. It is modeled after
the original version of the game on the Gobaith map.

This bundle comes with dummy graphics, as the original graphics can not be redistributed due to licensing restrictions.

The original sources used to derive this implementation can be found under https://github.com/Illarion-eV.
